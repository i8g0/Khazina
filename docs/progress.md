## Phase Progress

| Phase                         | Status             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Phase 1 – Foundation          | ✅ Completed (5/5) |
| Phase 2 – Frontend Foundation | ✅ Completed (7/7)   |
| Phase 3 – Backend Core        | ✅ Completed (frozen — Sprint 3.7) |
| Phase 4 – Authentication      | ✅ Completed (frozen — Sprint 4.5) |
| Phase 5 – AI Integration      | 🔄 In progress (Sprint 5.2 — architecture frozen) |

---

### Phase 3 — Definition of Done (Scope Boundary)

**Delivered in Phase 3:**

- PostgreSQL schema, SQLAlchemy ORM models, Alembic migrations
- Repository layer
- Service layer (business-rule, state-transition, and transaction logic only)
- CRUD REST APIs, Pydantic schemas, exception handling, dependency injection

**Deliberately not in Phase 3 (scheduled elsewhere):**

- No financial calculation engines → Phase 5, sprint 5.3 (Financial Analysis Engine)
- No Excel/CSV upload or parsing; no pandas/openpyxl → Phase 6, sprint 6.2 (Financial Statements upload/parsing)
- No AI/Ollama integration → Phase 5, sprint 5.1
- No authentication → Phase 4

Services currently persist and return caller-supplied values; they do not yet compute financial indicators from raw data. This is expected and correct for Phase 3.

### Sprint 2.8 - Phase 2 UI Final Density Pass

**Objective:** Global density polish (no redesign) so the application feels like a premium enterprise dashboard at 100% zoom on 1920×1080 — approximately 10–15% more compact.

**Delivered:**

- Wider effective content: container `max-w-[1760px]`, reduced page padding (`px-4/6/8`, `py-7/8`)
- Vertical rhythm reduced ~20%: page spacing `3.25rem/4rem`, section spacing `space-y-5/6`

### Maintenance — Package Manager Standardization (pnpm)

**Date:** 2026-07-11

- **pnpm adopted as the official package manager** for the project (pnpm v11.10.0, pinned via the `packageManager` field in `frontend/package.json`)
- **Package manager standardization completed** — all project commands and documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, ADR-004, AI prompts) now reference pnpm
- **npm lockfile removed** — `frontend/package-lock.json` deleted after verifying `pnpm-lock.yaml` (lockfileVersion 9.0) is present and healthy
- Verified: `pnpm install` completes with lockfile up to date; frontend starts and serves all routes via `pnpm dev`

---

### Maintenance — Frontend Dockerfile Migration (pnpm)

**Date:** 2026-07-12

- **`frontend/Dockerfile` migrated to pnpm** — `PNPM_HOME` env set; `corepack enable pnpm` in deps and builder stages; copies `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`; `pnpm build`
- **Reason:** Dockerfile still referenced the deleted `package-lock.json` and `npm ci`, which would have broken the Docker frontend build after package-manager standardization
- **Pending verification:** A real `docker compose build` has not yet been executed to validate this change

---

### Maintenance — Alembic URL escaping for ConfigParser (`%` in passwords)

**Date:** 2026-07-13

- **Issue:** `alembic upgrade head` failed on fresh PostgreSQL installs when `DATABASE_URL` contained `%` (or other values that ConfigParser treats as interpolation), raising `ValueError: invalid interpolation syntax` before any DB connection was attempted.
- **Cause:** `config.set_main_option("sqlalchemy.url", settings.database_url)` passes the URL through Python's `configparser`, which interprets `%` as interpolation syntax.
- **Fix:** Escape percent signs before registering the URL: `settings.database_url.replace("%", "%%")` in `backend/alembic/env.py`. ConfigParser stores `%%` as a literal `%`; SQLAlchemy still receives the correct connection string via `create_engine(settings.database_url)` in online mode.
- **Scope:** Infrastructure compatibility fix only — no change to ORM models, migrations, services, or runtime application behavior.

---

### Phase 3 — Sprint 3.0: Business Domain Discovery

**Date:** 2026-07-12

**Status:** Completed — awaiting Technical Lead approval before Sprint 3.1

**Deliverables:**

- [BUSINESS_DOMAIN_DISCOVERY.md](BUSINESS_DOMAIN_DISCOVERY.md) — official business domain reference derived from frozen Phase 2 frontend
- Six primary domains identified and analyzed (Dashboard, Data Repository, Waste Detection, Risk Management, Simulation, Reporting)
- Cross-cutting concepts documented (AI Recommendations, Departmental Context, Executive Timeline)
- Domain Boundaries section added (business ownership separation)

### Phase 3 — Sprint 3.2 Revision: Technical Lead Review Revisions

**Date:** 2026-07-12

**Status:** Completed — awaiting Technical Lead sign-off before Sprint 3.3

**Review outcome:** Approved with minor revisions

**Revisions applied:**

1. User Management wording — replaced Phase 4 references with "deferred until User Management is introduced"
2. Timeline polymorphic association — expanded documentation (§4.25.1, DD-11)
3. Future recommendation sources — Reports documented as future extension (§14.3); no schema changes
4. Report field renamed — `preview_text` → `summary` with naming rationale (§4.23.1)
5. Simulation display values — classified as presentation-only; business numerics in chart points (§4.18.1)

**Validation:**

| Check | Result |
| ----- | ------ |
| All TL review items addressed | ✅ Pass |
| Schema entities/relationships unchanged | ✅ Pass |
| No implementation work performed | ✅ Pass |
| Documentation internally consistent | ✅ Pass |

---

### Phase 3 — Sprint 3.3: SQLAlchemy Models

**Date:** 2026-07-12

**Status:** Completed — awaiting Technical Lead approval before Sprint 3.4 (Alembic Migrations)

**Deliverables:**

- SQLAlchemy 2.x ORM models in `backend/app/db/models/` organized by business domain
- Shared `Base`, UUID primary key mixin, and timestamp mixins in `backend/app/db/base.py`
- Approved enums in `backend/app/db/models/enums.py`
- 25 tables mapped (all entities from DATABASE_SCHEMA_DESIGN.md §4)
- Relationships with `back_populates`, FK `ondelete` behavior, and cascade rules per approved design
- ORM-level constraints: unique constraints, check constraints, partial unique index on active reporting period
- Model registry exported via `app/db/models/__init__.py` for future Alembic autogeneration

**Validation:**

| Check | Result |
| ----- | ------ |
| All approved entities have models | ✅ Pass (25 tables) |
| Models import without circular import errors | ✅ Pass |
| No schema redesign | ✅ Pass |
| No Alembic migrations created | ✅ Pass |
| No repositories, services, or APIs | ✅ Pass |

**Next step:** Await Technical Lead approval, then proceed to Sprint 3.4 (Alembic Migrations).

---

### Phase 3 — Sprint 3.4: Alembic Initial Migration

**Date:** 2026-07-12

**Status:** Completed — awaiting Technical Lead approval before Sprint 3.5 (Repository Layer)

**Deliverables:**

- `alembic/env.py` wired to `Base.metadata`: all ORM models registered via `app.db.models`; `compare_type` and `compare_server_default` enabled for autogeneration
- Initial migration `alembic/versions/f58d9c1c4a02_initial_schema.py` (autogenerated from Sprint 3.3 models, manually reviewed against DATABASE_SCHEMA_DESIGN.md)
- Migration creates the complete approved schema: 25 tables, 25 primary keys, 43 foreign keys with approved RESTRICT/CASCADE/SET NULL delete rules, 5 named unique constraints, 7 named check constraints, 18 B-tree indexes, 2 partial indexes (active reporting period unique; dashboard-featured recommendations), UUID `gen_random_uuid()` defaults, `now()` timestamp defaults, and business server defaults (statuses, flags, `platform_name` = خزينة)
- Full downgrade path dropping all tables and indexes in dependency order

**Validation (performed against a fresh PostgreSQL 16.2 instance):**

| Check | Result |
| ----- | ------ |
| `alembic upgrade head` on empty database | ✅ Pass (no manual intervention) |
| All 25 expected tables created | ✅ Pass (+ `alembic_version`) |
| Constraint census: 26 PK / 43 FK / 5 UNIQUE / 7 CHECK | ✅ Pass — matches ORM models |
| FK `ON DELETE` behaviors match approved design §5.1 | ✅ Pass (verified per-FK from `pg_constraint`) |
| All indexes present incl. 2 partial indexes | ✅ Pass (verified from `pg_indexes`) |
| Server defaults incl. UUID and Arabic default | ✅ Pass (verified from `information_schema.columns`) |
| Post-migration drift check (`compare_metadata`) | ✅ Pass (0 differences vs ORM metadata) |
| `alembic downgrade base` | ✅ Pass (only `alembic_version` remains) |
| `alembic upgrade head` after downgrade | ✅ Pass (26 tables restored) |
| No ORM model changes required | ✅ Pass (no migration-blocking defects found) |

**Notes:**

- Design doc §9 lists some indexes with `DESC` ordering (e.g., `uploaded_at DESC`); Sprint 3.3 models define them as ascending B-tree indexes, which serve both scan directions in PostgreSQL. Models are the approved authority — migration matches the models. Non-blocking; flagged for TL awareness.
- Validation used a throwaway local PostgreSQL 16.2 instance; no Docker configuration was touched.

**Next step:** Await Technical Lead approval, then proceed to Sprint 3.5 (Repository Layer).

---

### Phase 3 — Sprint 3.5: Repository Layer

**Date:** 2026-07-12

**Status:** Completed — awaiting Technical Lead approval before Service Layer implementation

**Deliverables:**

- `backend/app/repositories/` — ten domain repositories per the TL directive structure: Organization, Department, Financial, Analysis, Waste, Risk, Simulation, Report, Recommendation, Timeline
- `base.py` — shared `BaseRepository` holding the injected `Session` with generic persistence helpers (get/require/add/add_all/update/delete/list/count/paginate) so query logic is not duplicated
- `exceptions.py` — `EntityNotFoundError` extending core `AppError` (404), raised by `require_*` lookups
- All queries in SQLAlchemy 2.x `select()` style; list methods support limit/offset pagination and MVP-justified filters (design §9 query patterns)
- Session injected via constructor (DI-compatible with `get_db`); repositories flush but never commit — transactions belong to the Service Layer
- No business logic: no KPI calculation, business validation, report generation, or AI triggers

**Validation:**

| Check | Result |
| ----- | ------ |
| All repositories import successfully | ✅ Pass (12 exports) |
| Smoke suite against migrated PostgreSQL 16.2 | ✅ Pass (47/47 checks) |
| Session injection (one session shared across all repos) | ✅ Pass |
| CRUD, filters, pagination, ordering, unique-key lookups | ✅ Pass |
| `EntityNotFoundError` raised on missing entity | ✅ Pass |
| Database errors propagate (RESTRICT `IntegrityError` not swallowed) | ✅ Pass |
| No services, APIs, auth, caching, or AI introduced | ✅ Pass |
| No ORM model or Alembic changes | ✅ Pass |

**Next step:** Await Technical Lead approval, then proceed to Service Layer implementation.

---

### Phase 3 — Sprint 3.5 Clarification: HTTP-Agnostic Repository Exceptions

**Date:** 2026-07-12

**TL review finding:** `EntityNotFoundError` extended `AppError` and carried `status_code=404` — an HTTP concept inside the repository layer.

**Resolution:** Refactored `app/repositories/exceptions.py` into pure exceptions: new `RepositoryError(Exception)` base and `EntityNotFoundError(RepositoryError)` carrying only `entity_name` and `entity_id`. The module no longer imports `app.core.exceptions`; HTTP mapping is deferred to upper layers. No other repository files changed.

**Validation:** Not a subclass of `AppError`; no `status_code` attribute; no `app.core` import in the module; all 12 repository exports still import cleanly.

---

### Phase 3 — Service Layer

**Date:** 2026-07-12

**Status:** Completed — awaiting Technical Lead approval before Sprint 3.6 (CRUD APIs)

**Deliverables:**

- `backend/app/services/` — ten domain services per the TL directive structure: Organization, Department, Financial, Analysis, Waste, Risk, Simulation, Report, Recommendation, Timeline
- `base.py` — shared `BaseService` owning transaction boundaries: unit-of-work helper that commits on success, rolls back on any error, and translates commit-time `IntegrityError` into `BusinessRuleViolationError`; plus shared not-found and organization-ownership validation helpers
- `exceptions.py` — HTTP-agnostic business exception hierarchy (`ServiceError`: validation, not-found, duplicate, ownership, invalid-state, invalid-state-transition, integrity-rule violation)
- Business workflows implemented: single-active-organization rule; one-active-reporting-period switching; financial upload lifecycle (pending → processing → completed/failed → ready_for_analysis) with mandatory failure messages and success/failure import records; analysis run lifecycle (pending → processing → completed/failed) with timeline event on completion; waste result recording (1:1 per run, percentage/amount validation, trend point upsert); risk lifecycle (active → in_progress → closed) with mitigation plan rules; simulation workflow (draft scenario → run creates shared AnalysisRun + 1:1 SimulationRun → results finalize run and scenario); report publication (draft → ready with published_at stamp and timeline event); recommendation registration enforcing the exclusive-source rule and dashboard featuring; timeline polymorphic-reference validation at the application layer
- Dependencies (Session + repositories) injected via constructor; services execute no raw SQL and contain no HTTP concepts

**Validation:**

| Check | Result |
| ----- | ------ |
| All services import successfully | ✅ Pass (10 services + base + exceptions) |
| Constructor dependency injection instantiates every service | ✅ Pass (10/10) |
| Transaction helper commits on success, rolls back on error | ✅ Pass (smoke test) |
| `IntegrityError` at commit translated to business exception with rollback | ✅ Pass (smoke test) |
| No HTTP concepts in services (no FastAPI/status codes/routers) | ✅ Pass (grep audit) |
| No raw SQL in services (all access via repositories) | ✅ Pass |
| No repository, ORM model, Alembic, or frontend changes | ✅ Pass |
| Linter | ✅ Pass (no errors) |

**Next step:** Await Technical Lead approval, then proceed to Sprint 3.6 (CRUD APIs).

---

### Phase 3 — Sprint 3.6: CRUD APIs

**Date:** 2026-07-12

**Status:** Completed — awaiting Technical Lead approval before Sprint 3.7 (Backend Core Freeze)

**Deliverables:**

- `backend/app/api/deps.py` — FastAPI dependency injection chain: Session → Repositories → Services, plus shared `PaginationParams`
- `backend/app/api/v1/` — ten domain routers (Organization, Department, Financial, Analysis, Waste, Risk, Simulation, Report, Recommendation, Timeline) wired through `router.py`
- `backend/app/schemas/` — Pydantic Create / Update / Response schemas per domain; ORM models never exposed directly
- `app/core/exception_handlers.py` — HTTP translation for `ServiceError` hierarchy (404/400/409/403 mappings)
- 87 REST operations across 61 paths, organization-scoped under `/api/v1/organizations/{organization_id}/…`
- Routers remain thin: validate/bind request shapes, call service methods, map ORM results to response schemas

**Validation:**

| Check | Result |
| ----- | ------ |
| All routers import successfully | ✅ Pass |
| OpenAPI schema generates | ✅ Pass (61 paths, 87 operations) |
| Dependency injection (Session → Repos → Services) | ✅ Pass |
| Service exception HTTP mapping registered | ✅ Pass |
| No business logic in routers (delegate to services only) | ✅ Pass |
| No authentication / JWT introduced | ✅ Pass |
| No service, repository, ORM model, Alembic, or frontend changes | ✅ Pass |
| Linter | ✅ Pass (no errors) |

**Next step:** Await Technical Lead approval, then proceed to Sprint 3.7 (Backend Core Freeze).

---

### Phase 3 — Sprint 3.7: Backend Core Freeze

**Date:** 2026-07-12

**Status:** Completed — Backend Core officially frozen; awaiting Technical Lead approval before Phase 4

**Review scope:** Database schema, SQLAlchemy models, Alembic migrations, Repository Layer, Service Layer, CRUD APIs, dependency injection, exception handling, OpenAPI, documentation, code quality.

**Architecture validation:**

| Layer boundary | Result |
| -------------- | ------ |
| API → Service → Repository → ORM → Database | ✅ Pass — no bypasses detected |
| Routers do not access repositories directly | ✅ Pass — only `app/api/deps.py` wires repositories into services |
| Services free of HTTP concepts | ✅ Pass — no FastAPI imports in services |
| Repositories free of business logic | ✅ Pass — persistence and query helpers only |
| Repositories flush only (no commit/rollback) | ✅ Pass |
| Services own commit/rollback | ✅ Pass — `BaseService._transaction()` only |
| Routers never manage transactions | ✅ Pass |

**Dependency review:** No circular imports across `app.main`, `app.api.deps`, `app.api.v1.router`, `app.services`, `app.repositories`, `app.db.models`. No repository→service dependencies. No service→service circular dependencies.

**Exception review:** Repository exceptions (`RepositoryError`, `EntityNotFoundError`) are infrastructure-only with no HTTP semantics. Service exceptions (`ServiceError` hierarchy) are business-only. HTTP translation registered in `app/core/exception_handlers.py` for `ServiceError`, `AppError`, `RequestValidationError`, and generic `Exception`. Services translate missing entities via `_found()` → `ResourceNotFoundError` rather than propagating repository exceptions.

**API validation:** OpenAPI generates successfully (61 paths, 88 operations, 104 schemas). All endpoints have summaries and response models. Health, OpenAPI, and Pydantic validation (422) smoke tests pass. Service exception mapping verified (404 for `ResourceNotFoundError`).

**Database validation:** ORM registers 25 tables; initial Alembic migration creates 25 tables — names match with no drift detected. Runtime `alembic upgrade` not re-executed in this review (PostgreSQL unavailable in review environment); prior Sprint 3.4 validation remains authoritative.

**Code quality review:** No `TODO`, `FIXME`, `NotImplemented`, bare `pass`, or temporary markers found under `backend/app/`. No duplicate service implementations detected.

**Files modified:** None — no defects requiring code changes were discovered.

**Technical debt noted (non-blocking):**

- Some read-by-ID service methods (e.g. `get_department`, `get_report`) do not verify `organization_id` ownership; mutating operations enforce ownership. Acceptable for MVP single-tenant context; address when User Management is introduced.
- Database connectivity failures surface as HTTP 500 via the generic unhandled handler; production mode (`debug=False`) returns a generic message without SQLAlchemy details.
- No automated integration test suite yet; validation performed via import checks, OpenAPI generation, and smoke tests.

**Next step:** Await Technical Lead approval, then proceed to Phase 4 — Sprint 4.1 (User System).

---

### Phase 4 — Sprint 4.1: User System

**Deliverables:**

- `backend/app/core/config/database.py` — `DATABASE_URL` required from environment (removed insecure default)
- `backend/app/core/config/auth.py` — `JWT_SECRET_KEY` minimum 32 characters; `JWT_ALGORITHM` restricted to `HS256`
- `backend/app/core/middleware/security_headers.py` — standard defensive HTTP headers
- `backend/app/core/logging_filters.py` — redacts passwords, tokens, Authorization headers, and database URLs from logs
- `backend/app/core/exception_handlers.py` — production-safe auth/DB/integrity error messages; SQLAlchemy error handler
- `backend/app/core/logging.py` — attaches sensitive-data filter to application log handlers
- `backend/app/main.py` — registers security headers middleware
- `backend/.env.example` — documents required `DATABASE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET_KEY`

**Security review (no auth/authz redesign):**

| ---- | ------- |
| JWT signature + expiration validation | ✅ Confirmed — no change required |
| `get_current_user` inactive-user handling | ✅ Confirmed — no change required |
| Role hierarchy + org ownership | ✅ Confirmed — no change required |
| 401 vs 403 behavior | ✅ Improved — production auth/forbidden responses sanitized |

**Validation:**

| Check | Result |
| ----- | ------ |
| App starts with required env secrets | ✅ Pass |
| Alembic at head | ✅ Pass |
| OpenAPI / Swagger builds | ✅ Pass |
| Login works | ✅ Pass |
| Authorization works | ✅ Pass |
| Security headers present | ✅ Pass |
| Production 401 message sanitized | ✅ Pass |

### Phase 4 — Sprint 4.5: Authentication Freeze

**Date:** 2026-07-13

**Status:** Completed — **Phase 4 (Authentication & Security) officially frozen**; awaiting Technical Lead approval before Phase 5

**Review scope:** User System (4.1), JWT Authentication (4.2), Roles & Permissions (4.3), Security Hardening (4.4)

**Files modified:** None — no defects requiring code changes were discovered

**End-to-end validation:**

| Flow / failure case | Result |
| ------------------- | ------ |
| Create user → login → JWT → protected endpoint | ✅ Pass |
| Role validation (admin endpoint) | ✅ Pass |
| Organization ownership | ✅ Pass |
| Invalid password | ✅ Pass (401) |
| Invalid JWT | ✅ Pass (401) |
| Expired JWT | ✅ Pass (401) |
| Disabled user (login + valid token) | ✅ Pass (401) |
| Wrong organization | ✅ Pass (403) |
| Insufficient role | ✅ Pass (403) |
| bcrypt hash/verify | ✅ Pass |
| Security headers | ✅ Pass |
| OpenAPI builds (65 paths) | ✅ Pass |
| Import / circular dependency check | ✅ Pass |

**Architecture validation:**

| Layer boundary | Result |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Repository — persistence only | ✅ Pass |
| Service — business logic, no HTTP | ✅ Pass |
| Router — thin, dependency composition | ✅ Pass |
| DI chain unchanged | ✅ Pass |
| No circular dependencies | ✅ Pass |

**Security validation:**

| Control | Result |
| ------- | ------ |
| bcrypt password storage | ✅ Pass |
| JWT signature + expiration (HS256) | ✅ Pass |
| Required secrets, fail-fast | ✅ Pass |
| Security headers middleware | ✅ Pass |
| Log redaction filter | ✅ Pass |
| Production error sanitization | ✅ Pass |

**Technical debt noted (non-blocking):**

- Local `backend/.env` must include `JWT_SECRET_KEY` (≥32 chars) alongside `DATABASE_URL` for runtime startup
- No refresh tokens or session management (deferred by design)
- No automated auth integration test suite in CI yet
- Uvicorn access logs are not filtered for Authorization headers (application loggers are)
- No login rate limiting (future hardening if needed)

**Recommendation for Phase 5:** Proceed with frontend authentication integration and API consumption, building on the frozen JWT + role-based authorization stack. Backend AI and business-domain features can wire `CurrentUserDep` / permission dependencies without modifying the auth layer.

**Next step:** Await Technical Lead approval, then proceed to Phase 5.

---

### Maintenance — Documentation Alignment (pre–Phase 5)

**Date:** 2026-07-13

**Status:** Completed — governance and documentation debt closed before Phase 5

### Maintenance — AI Model Configuration Neutrality (pre–Sprint 5.2)

**Date:** 2026-07-13

**Status:** Completed

**Objective:** Remove assumed/preferred model names from configuration examples; keep AI infrastructure model-agnostic.

**Changes:** Cleared `OLLAMA_MODEL` examples in `backend/.env.example` and `docker/.env.example`; removed Compose default `${OLLAMA_MODEL:-llama3.2}`; clarified `AiSettings` field description and `ARCHITECTURE.md` note.

**Validation:** No model name hardcoded in application code; model switch requires only `OLLAMA_MODEL` env change.

---

### Maintenance — Documentation Model-Agnostic Consistency (pre–Sprint 5.2)

**Date:** 2026-07-13

**Status:** Completed

**Objective:** Final documentation pass — ensure no doc recommends or assumes a default AI model.

**Files updated:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ADR/006-ollama.md`, `docs/GLOSSARY.md`, `docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`, `docs/AI_GUIDELINES.md`

**Validation:** Searched all of `docs/` for `llama3`, `llama3.1`, `llama3.2`, `qwen`, `qwen3`, `default model`, and `recommended model` — no active policy violations; only historical maintenance notes reference removed defaults.

---

### Phase 5 — Sprint 5.2: AI Architecture Freeze (Pre-Implementation)

**Date:** 2026-07-13

**Status:** Completed — **AI architecture officially frozen (documentation only)**; awaiting Technical Lead approval before implementation sprints

**Objective:** Create the official AI Architecture specification as the single source of truth for Phase 5+ AI implementation. No code, APIs, or logic changes.

**Deliverables:**

- `docs/AI_ARCHITECTURE.md` — normative specification (20 sections: pipeline, facts contract, LLM boundaries, number guard, privacy, multi-agent policy, etc.)
- `docs/ADR/008-ai-architecture.md` — ADR recording adoption of the Facts-First AI Pipeline
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — cross-reference to AI_ARCHITECTURE.md and ADR 008
- `docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` — Phase 5 deliverables/exit criteria updated
- `docs/AI_GUIDELINES.md` — AI_ARCHITECTURE.md added to mandatory pre-implementation reading

**Scope compliance:**

| Constraint | Result |
| ---------- | ------ |
| No backend code changes | ✅ Pass |
| No frontend changes | ✅ Pass |
| No new APIs | ✅ Pass |
| Documentation only | ✅ Pass |

**Current Development Baseline documented:** `Qwen3:8B` (temporary; configuration-only replacement; no architectural impact)

---

### Phase 5 — Sprint 5.2 Refinement: AI Architecture Documentation Review

**Date:** 2026-07-13

**Status:** Completed

**Objective:** Apply Technical Lead review comments to frozen AI documentation. No code or architecture redesign.

**Sections updated:**

| `docs/ADR/008-ai-architecture.md` | Decision items 4, 6, 7; alternatives table; consequences |
| `docs/progress.md` | This entry |

**Validation:** Terminology consistent — "Current Development Baseline", "Multi-Agent deferred", Number Guard never corrects output.

**Next step:** Await Technical Lead approval; proceed to Sprint 5.3+ implementation.

---

### Phase 5 — Sprint 5.2: Prompt Engine (Implementation)

**Date:** 2026-07-13

**Status:** Completed — awaiting Technical Lead approval

### Phase 5 — Sprint 5.2 Maintenance: Prompt Engine Refinement

**Date:** 2026-07-13

**Status:** Completed

**Objective:** Naming consistency, versioning, extensibility, and metadata — no behaviour changes.

**Changes:**

- Renamed `BusinessFact` → `PromptFact` (prompt-layer type; distinct from future Facts Contract)
- Added `PROMPT_VERSION = "1.0"` and `PROMPT_LANGUAGE` in `app/ai/prompts/version.py`
- `ComposedPrompt` extended with `prompt_version`, `language`, `created_at` metadata
- `PromptTask` template registry with `register_task_template()` / `supported_tasks()` for future tasks
- Public exports: `PROMPT_VERSION`, `PROMPT_LANGUAGE`, `supported_tasks`, `iter_supported_tasks`

**Validation:** Prompt text (`system_prompt`, `user_prompt`, `final_prompt`) unchanged for all four tasks; metadata populated; public API works.

---

### Architecture Standard — Prompt Metadata & Language Policy Adoption

**Date:** 2026-07-13

**Status:** Completed — permanent AI architecture standards adopted

**Policies adopted:**

1. **Prompt Metadata Policy** — mandatory `PromptMetadata` on every composed prompt; centralized in `build_prompt_metadata()` / `PromptComposer`
2. **Prompt Language Policy** — `DEFAULT_PROMPT_LANGUAGE` configuration; language packs in `app/ai/prompts/languages/`; one language per prompt

**Implementation:**

- `app/ai/prompts/metadata.py` — `PromptMetadata`, `build_prompt_metadata()`
- `app/ai/prompts/language_config.py` — `get_default_prompt_language()`
- `app/ai/prompts/languages/` — `LanguagePack` registry; `ar` pack with all prompt strings
- `app/core/config/ai.py` — `default_prompt_language` / `DEFAULT_PROMPT_LANGUAGE`
- `docs/AI_ARCHITECTURE.md` — Prompt Metadata Policy + Prompt Language Policy sections
- `docs/ADR/008-ai-architecture.md` — policies recorded as architectural standards

**Validation:** Prompt text unchanged with `DEFAULT_PROMPT_LANGUAGE=ar`; metadata fields present; language configurable via env.

### Phase 5 — Sprint 5.3A: Business Engine Architecture

**Date:** 2026-07-13

**Status:** Completed — **Business Engine architecture officially frozen**; awaiting Technical Lead approval before Sprint 5.3B

**Objective:** Freeze the deterministic Business Engine architecture for all future analysis engines. No calculations, no engine implementations, no APIs, no AI.

**Deliverables:**

- `docs/BUSINESS_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md` — normative specification (layers, lifecycle, Facts Contract design, extensibility, error handling)
- `docs/ADR/009-business-engine-architecture.md` — ADR recording adoption
- `backend/app/business/` — package scaffold (interface, exceptions, registry, placeholder subpackages)
- `backend/app/business/base.py` — abstract `BusinessEngine` interface (`run`, `analyze`, `assemble_facts`, `manifest`)
- `backend/app/business/manifest.py` — `EngineManifest` (Sprint 5.3A-R)
- `backend/app/business/registry.py` — immutable engine registry with freeze lifecycle (Sprint 5.3A-R)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/AI_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/README.md` — cross-references

**Scope compliance:**

| Constraint | Result |
| ---------- | ------ |
| No business calculations | ✅ Pass |
| No concrete engine implementation | ✅ Pass |
| Facts Contract designed, not implemented | ✅ Pass |
| AI layer unchanged and isolated | ✅ Pass |
| No API / database / frontend changes | ✅ Pass |

**Next step:** Await Technical Lead approval, then begin Sprint 5.3B (Facts Contract implementation + first engine).

| Immutable Engine Registry | Lifecycle: Initialization → Registration → Freeze → Read Only; `RegistryFrozenError` after freeze |
| Fact Assembler | Renamed from Fact Builder project-wide (`assemblers/`, `assemble_facts()`) |

**Deliverables:**

- `backend/app/business/manifest.py` — frozen `EngineManifest` dataclass
- `backend/app/business/registry.py` — immutable registry with `freeze_registry()`, `get_engine_manifest()`, `registered_manifests()`
- `backend/app/business/base.py` — `manifest` property; `assemble_facts()` replaces `build_facts()`
- `backend/app/business/exceptions.py` — `RegistryFrozenError`
- `backend/app/business/assemblers/` — renamed from `builders/`
- `docs/BUSINESS_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md` — Manifest, Registry Lifecycle, Immutable Registry Policy, Fact Assembler sections
- `docs/ADR/009-business-engine-architecture.md` — refinement recorded (no new ADR)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — cross-reference updated

**Validation:**

| Check | Result |
| ----- | ------ |
| Manifest mandatory on interface | ✅ Pass |
| Registry consumes manifest | ✅ Pass |
| Registry immutable after freeze | ✅ Pass |
| Fact Builder fully renamed | ✅ Pass |
| No concrete Business Engine | ✅ Pass |
| No `app.ai` imports in `app/business/` | ✅ Pass |
| No calculations / APIs / AI changes | ✅ Pass |

**Next step:** Sprint 5.3B — Facts Contract implementation and first Business Engine.

## Open Items

### Open Decision — Frontend Content Max Width

Three-way inconsistency on content max width:

- `docs/FRONTEND_SPECIFICATION.md` line 53: max **1440px**
- `frontend/components/layout/page-container.tsx`: `max-w-[1440px]` (matches spec)
- `frontend/lib/app-nav.tsx` (line ~42): `max-w-[1760px]` (contradicts spec and `page-container.tsx`)

The Tech Lead must decide the single correct max width. After that decision, both components and spec line 53 will be reconciled in a follow-up.
